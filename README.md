# signup-tests

This is a test assignment. 
Please note that this was my first experience using Cypress â€“ seemed like a good idea to mix business with pleasure.

This suite is not fully configured for cross-browser testing because Cypress runner depends on browsers installed on user's machine.
In a controlled environment this is easy to configure. Do not suppose I haven't do that because I didn't thought of that.

**Required to run**:
node v16+

**Run tests**:
```
$ npm install
$ npm run test
```
